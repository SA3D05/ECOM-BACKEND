To split icons from a single SVG file into individual SVG files, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Open the SVG File**: Use a vector graphics editor like Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or an online SVG editor.

2. **Identify Icons**: Locate each icon within the SVG file. Icons are typically grouped or defined by `<g>` tags or individual `<path>` elements.

3. **Isolate Each Icon**:
   - Select an icon or group of elements that make up the icon.
   - Copy the selected elements.

4. **Create New SVG Files**:
   - Open a new document in your vector graphics editor.
   - Paste the copied icon into the new document.
   - Ensure that the new SVG file has the necessary `<svg>` tags and attributes (like width, height, viewBox, etc.).

5. **Save the New SVG File**: Save the new document as an SVG file, giving it a meaningful name that represents the icon.

6. **Repeat**: Repeat the process for each icon in the original SVG file.

### Example Using Inkscape:

1. Open your SVG file in Inkscape.
2. Use the "Select and Transform Objects" tool (arrow icon) to select an icon.
3. Copy the selected icon (Ctrl+C).
4. Create a new document (File > New).
5. Paste the icon (Ctrl+V).
6. Adjust the canvas size if necessary (File > Document Properties).
7. Save the new file (File > Save As) and choose SVG format.
8. Name the file appropriately and repeat for each icon.

### Automated Approach:

If you have programming skills, you can automate this process using a script. For example, using Python with libraries like `svgpathtools` or `lxml` to parse the SVG file and extract each icon into separate files.

### Note:
If you provide the SVG file or its content, I can guide you through the process more specifically or help with a script. However, I cannot manipulate files directly.
